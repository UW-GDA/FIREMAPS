This folder will house the SAR data files for FIREMAPS after running Download_Data.ipynb.

This folder also contains the WFIGS Wildfire perimeter datset that we utilized.

Important Note:
Due to the large size of SAR imagery, the data used in this project was stored locally and not pushed. Similarly, the tiles of chipped data are too large to upload to GitHub. To run this on your own, you will need to follow the process laid out in the 'Label_Chip_Data' notebook to reproduce the tiles yourself.
